# Gitter Guidelines

Many of the questions that asked on the Deeplearning4j Gitter support channel can be answered elsewhere. To respect the Skymind team's time, Deeplearning4j users are kindly asked to remember a few things:

1. Please use Google before you ask a question. The Deeplearning4j Gitter channel should not be used as a human-enhanced search engine. (We promise that you'll end up with a better open-source framework if you only ask us the hard questions...)
2. If you don't receive an immediate response, please post again and flag your question with the Gitter ID of one of the people in the channel answering questions. If you do receive a response and link, please spend some time reading and trying to understand the response and additional resources before you keep asking that question. 
3. To answer questions, we need to know about your OS, Java version, Maven version and we may even need to see your code and stacktrace. When we ask for code, please send us a gist using https://gist.github.com/. If you can't give us code, in many cases we can't help you. (It's also a great sign of commitment on your part!)
4. We're not perfect, and neither is our documentation. If you find ways for us to improve, please email us at help@skymind.io and let us know what we need to fix.
